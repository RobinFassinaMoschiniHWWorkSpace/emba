# EMBA
## The security analyzer for firmware of embedded devices

*EMBA* is designed as the central firmware analysis and SBOM tool for penetration testers, product security teams, developers and responsible product managers. It supports the complete security analysis process starting with *firmware extraction*, doing *static analysis* and *dynamic analysis* via emulation, building the SBOM and finally generating a web based vulnerability report. *EMBA* automatically discovers possible weak spots and vulnerabilities in firmware. Examples are insecure binaries, old and outdated software components, potentially vulnerable scripts, or hard-coded passwords. *EMBA* is a command line tool with the possibility to generate an easy-to-use web report for further analysis.

*EMBA* assists the penetration testers, product security teams and developers in the identification of weak spots and vulnerabilities in the firmware image. *EMBA* provides as much information as possible about the firmware, that the tester can decide on focus areas and is responsible for verifying and interpreting the results.
